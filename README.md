**Real-time AI-based drowsiness detection using OpenCV and deep learning**  

![Drowsiness Detection Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=Drowsiness+Detection+System)  

### 🚀 Overview  
This project is an AI-powered **drowsiness detection system** that helps prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. It uses **computer vision (OpenCV)** and a **deep learning model** to detect whether a person's eyes are open or closed in real-time.  

### 🔥 Features  
✅ **Real-time Face & Eye Detection** using OpenCV  
✅ **Deep Learning-based Eye Classification**  
✅ **Webcam Support** for continuous monitoring  
✅ **Alerts when drowsiness is detected**  
✅ **High Accuracy Model with Pretrained CNN**  

### 🖼️ Demo

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** 👀  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** 🧠  
- **Deep Learning (CNN Model)**  

### 🛠️ Installation  
1️⃣ **Clone this repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Varshamishra56/Drowsiness_Detection_model.git
```
2️⃣ **Navigate to the project directory**  
```bash
cd Drowsiness_Detection_model
```
3️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4️⃣ **Run the application**  
Run the Model.ipynb file

### 📌 How It Works  
- The **webcam captures frames** in real-time.  
- **Face and eyes are detected** using Haar Cascades.  
- The **CNN model predicts eye status** (open or closed).  
- If the eyes are closed for a certain duration, **a drowsiness alert is triggered**.  

### 🎯 Use Cases  
🚗 **Driver Safety Monitoring**  
🖥️ **Workplace Fatigue Detection**  
🏥 **Healthcare & Patient Monitoring**
